# Coding Quiz Homework Week 4
The objective of the assignment was to create a quiz which has multiple questions that the user will received feedback on when they answer correctly or incorrectly. A timer keeps track of how the user is doing and acts as the user's final score when they have completed the quiz. The application stores a score in the high scores list if it is a new entry, or if it beats an existing entry's score. This data persists across sessions because it's stored in localStorage.
